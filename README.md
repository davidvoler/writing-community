writing-community - or Open Source Creating Writing
===================================================

Some question before we start
-----------------------------
Can we extend the concept of open source to include creating writing as we have for software?

Here are some answers I got:

In wikipidia people write arciles together. 

No, This is impossible in software or a wikipedia article we have a clear purpose, whereas in creative writing it is much more complicated, even if you define a target detective story in the 17 centruary,and say 17 people are working on it, they will probably never manage to agree on the first page.

People care about Intelectual Property when it comes to creative writing, people write because they dream to become famous and important, it goes against the idea of "open source".

The Idea
--------
Site members can start a writing project
They decide if it is open to everyone or to some specific people only 
If more than one person is working on a project it is alwys forked, readers can always view a tree of the single writing project. There is not a well defined project completion, more likly we are going to end up with a few brances and leaves, some very different from the original idea.
